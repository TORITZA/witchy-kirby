A rudimentary drawing of Kirby made using Python's Turtle module. Happy Halloween! 

I do not own the GIF images embedded alongside the Python file of this project. All other assets were provided by:
- @Foreversleepy (https://giphy.com/Foreversleepy on Giphy, https://www.instagram.com/foreversleepydesigns/ on Instagram)
- @atelier_kazuna (https://giphy.com/atelier_kazuna on Giphy)

As this is my first Python drawing, I'm totally open to suggestions! In what ways can I improve my code?
